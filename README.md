# Debian Environment Bootstrap

Bootstraps a new Debrian (stretch or later) environment to my desired specifications to begin work.

This project was created after Chrome OS destroyed my Linux environment for the tenth time. To save time all of the dependencies of my default development environment have been placed on Github.

## Installing

To bootstrap a new environment run the following command from your user account in Debian

```
bash -c "$(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samsoir/debian-environment-bootstrap/master/install.sh)"
```

## License

Debian Environment Bootstrap is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
